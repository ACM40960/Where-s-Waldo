# Where's Waldo? AI

## Project Overview

The "Where's Waldo? AI" project uses machine learning techniques to detect Waldo in images. This project leverages the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify Waldo in various images, making it easier to locate him in the classic "Where's Waldo?" puzzles.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 to detect Waldo in images.
- **Image Annotation**: Visualizes detection results with bounding boxes around Waldo.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- `torch` 1.7.0 or later
- `torchvision` 0.8.0 or later
